### The Phonebook code challenge ###

This is the code challenge for Software developers. It aims to determine the coding competence on potential candidates.

# What is this repository for? #

### Quick summary ###

The Phonebook code challenge is a non-finished Java project that its name explains it. Fork it and show us what you're capable of. Actually, here's the list of requirements that we expect you to accomplish:

1. Enable the 'Add contact' functionality
2. Enable the 'Search contact' functionality. Search must be enabled to be performed by any available criteria.
3. List the existent contacts. 
4. Create a DB (do whatever to persist data, not in memory of course -_-)

* NOTE: For JavaScript developers, you can optionally port the backend to nodejs, and focus on the UI improvements for the frontend under PhoneBook/WebContent

### Notes ###

1. Apply design patterns taking into account that the system must be scalable.
